Outgrowth of some participants in [NaNoGenMo 2013](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo).

An ongoing "concern" that should trouble no-one.


github-pages "blog", repos for web-experiments, issues for discussion, etc.

Or not. we can shut it all down.


## Pronounciation := /ˈtekst ˈdʒen ˈtek/
Analogous to [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), it sounds like "Text-Gen-Tech"
